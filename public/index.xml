      <description>In my recent updates to this site I&amp;rsquo;ve added a new &amp;ldquo;Chart your results&amp;rdquo; tool on the siegfried page (in the right hand panel under &amp;ldquo;Try Siegfried&amp;rdquo;). This tool produces single page reports like this: https://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried/results/ea1zaj.
Before covering this tool in detail let&amp;rsquo;s recap some of the existing ways you can already analyse your results.
Other ways of charting and analysing your results Command-line charting I appreciate that not everyone is a command-line junkie, but the way I inspect results is just to use sf&amp;rsquo;s -log flag.</description>

The headline feature of this release is new functionality for the sf -update command requested by Ross Spencer.

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this site. Apologies to those who liked the old look, which used the retro-Windows BOOTSTRA.386 theme. I liked it too. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t have great readability. The new CSS is basic, but it is super lightweight and I can tinker with it. I&amp;rsquo;m using Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s Pure CSS framework.
Under the hood, I&amp;rsquo;ve simplified the site a bit too. It used to be a monolithic golang app, served on appengine, but now most of the static content is generated by Hugo.</description>

Updates to the PRONOM (v95), LOC FDD and tika-mimetypes signature files.

### Change Log v1.7.12 (2019-06-15)

Changed:

- update PRONOM to v95
- update LOC signatures to 2019-05-20
- update tika-mimetypes signatures to v1.21

Fixed:

- .docx files with .doc extensions panic due to bug in division of hints in container matcher. Thanks to Jean-SÃ©verin Lair for [reporting and sharing samples](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/126) and to VAIarchief for [additional report with example](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/127).
- mime-info signatures panic on some files due to duplicate entries in the freedesktop and tika signature files; spotted during an attempt at pair coding with Ross Spencer... thanks Ross and sorry for hogging the laptop! [#125](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/125)

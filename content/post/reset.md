So I've updated this site's CSS. Apologies to those who liked the [old look](https://web.archive.org/web/20170715074712/https://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried), which used the retro-Windows [BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) theme. I liked it too. But it didn't have great readability. The new look is basic, but it is super lightweight and I can tinker on it. It is based on Yahoo's [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/) framework.

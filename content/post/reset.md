So I've updated this site. Apologies to those who liked the [old look](https://web.archive.org/web/20170715074712/https://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried), which used the retro-Windows [BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) theme. I liked it too. But it didn't have great readability. The new CSS is basic, but it is super lightweight and I can tinker with it. I'm using Yahoo's [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/) framework. 

Under the hood, I've simplified the site a bit too. It used to be a monolithic golang app, served on appengine, but now most of the static content is generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). The golang app parts now mostly just power a few small webservices (the update server, the try siegfried service, the sets tool, and the **new chart tool**). You can explore most of these services on the [siegfried](/siegfried) page.

The site's code is up on [github](https://github.com/richardlehane/itforarchivists.com).

Version 1.7.6 of siegfried is now available. Get it [here](/siegfried).

This is a minor release that incorporates the latest PRONOM update (v92), introduces a "continue on error" flag (sf -coe) to force sf to keep going when it hits fatal file errors in directory walks, and restricts file scanning to regular files (in previous versions symlinks, devices, sockets etc. were scanned which caused fatal errors for some users).

Thanks to [Henk Vanstappen](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/107) for the bug report that prompted this release.

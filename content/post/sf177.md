Version 1.7.7 of siegfried is now available. Happy [#IDPD17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDPD17)!

Get it [here](/siegfried).

This minor release fixes bugs in the `roy inspect` command and in sf's handling of large container files.

A new sets file is included in this release, 'pronom-extensions.json', which creates sets for all extensions defined in PRONOM. You can use these new sets when building signatures e.g. `roy build -limit @.tiff` or when logging formats e.g. `sf -log @.doc DIR`.

The other addition in this release is the inclusion of version metadata for MIME-info signature files (e.g. freedesktop.org or tika MIME-types). You can define version metadata for MIME-info signature files by editing the MIME-info.json file in your /data directory.

Thanks to [Terry Jolliffe](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/109) and [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/108) for their bug reports.

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for full details on this release.

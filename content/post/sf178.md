Version 1.7.8 of siegfried is now available. Get it [here](/siegfried).

This minor release updates the PRONOM signatures to v93 and the LOC signatures to 2017-09-28.

As the only changes in this release are to signature files, you can just use `sf -update` if you've installed siegfried manually. This minor release is just for the convenience of users who have installed sf with package managers (i.e. debian or homebrew).

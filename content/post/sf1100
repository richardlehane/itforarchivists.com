### CHANGELOG v1.10.0 (2023-03-25)

- format classification included as "class" field in PRONOM results. Requested by [Robin Fran√ßois](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/discussions/207). Implemented by [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/commit/7f695720a752ac5fca3e1de8ba034b92ab6da1d9)
- `-noclass` flag added to roy build command. Use this flag to build signatures that omit the new "class" field from results.

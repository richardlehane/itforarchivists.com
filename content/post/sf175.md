Version 1.7.5 of siegfried is now available. Get it [here](/siegfried).

The headline feature of this release is new functionality for the `sf -update` command requested by [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/103). You can now use the `-update` flag to download or update non-[PRONOM](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx) signatures with a choice of [LOC FDD](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/descriptions.shtml), two flavours of [MIMEInfo](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/) ([Apache Tika's MIMEInfo](https://tika.apache.org/1.5/detection.html) and [freedesktop.org](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info/)), and [archivematica](https://www.artefactual.com/services/archivematica/) (latest PRONOM + archivematica extensions) signatures. There are two combo options as well: PRONOM/Tika/LOC and the Ross Spencer "deluxe" (PRONOM/Tika/freedesktop.org/LOC). 

PRONOM remains the default, so if you just do `sf -update` it will work as before. 

To go non-PRONOM, include one of "loc", "tika", "freedesktop", "pronom-tika-loc", "deluxe" or "archivematica" as an argument after the flags e.g. `sf -update freedesktop`. This command will overwrite 'default.sig' (the default signature file that sf loads). 

You can preserve your default signature file by providing an alternative `-sig` target: e.g. `sf -sig notdefault.sig -update loc`. If you use one of the signature options as a filename (with or without a .sig extension), you can omit the signature argument i.e. `sf -update -sig loc.sig` is equivalent to `sf -sig loc.sig -update loc`.
